# About

This is very much a WIP intended primarly for my personal use, but since I found no
kubernetes scripts for rofi I am opening this to public and will be glad if somebody helps me improve
on the idea.

## Purpose

Help execute common kubernetes taks quickly with the option to add custom shortcut commands.

## How it works

For now this simply starts new terminal and appends the command that is being run to history so you can easilly repeat the command on the same terminal or other terminals.

# Dependencies

Your system must have:
- [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) as you would expect.
- bash
- xclip

# Usage

Just copy `rofi-kubernetes-wrapper.sh` to your system, add execution rights and execute the script in method you most fancy.

# Contribution

Any contribution is welcome
